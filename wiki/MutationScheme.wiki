#summary How the program mutates

= genimagef's Mutation Scheme =
This mutation function is made up of four basic sections, and each of these four sections has four actions. Every action has an equal weight except for special cases (where noted).

*Special Case:* If the genome has no chomosomes, then it forces the mutation 'Insert Chomosome'.

== Chomosome Actions ==
These are actions that apply to chromosomes within the genome.

*Special Case:* If the genome has 100 chromosomes, it will *not* 'insert chromosome'.  This is effectively the maximum number of chromosomes.
=== Insert Chromosome ===
Inserts a chromosome with no points at a random index.  This chromosome has a random color and opacity.
=== Remove Chromosome ===
Removes a chromosome from a randomly chosen index.
=== Switch Chromosomes ===
Choses two random chromosomes and switches them in place.
=== Shuffle Chromosome ===
Shuffle the order of all chromosomes.
== Point Actions ==
These actions affect the size, shape, and location of the chromosomes' phenotype.  The phenotype may be polygons, triangles, ellipses, circles, rectangles, diamonds, etc...
=== Insert Point ===
This randomly inserts a point.  For polygons, this inserts a point randomly into its list of points.  For ellipses and other phenotypes with a fixed number of points, this overwrites a randomly chosen with a new randomly placed point.
=== Remove Point ===
This randomly removes a point.  For polygons this removes a randomly selected point in the list of points.  For ellipses and other phenotypes with a fixed number of points, this overwrites a randomly chosen point with a new randomly placed point.
=== Switch Points ===

== Opacity Actions ==
== Color Actions ==
