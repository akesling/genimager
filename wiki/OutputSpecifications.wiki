== Text-based Output ==
Example Formatting for xml-based output:

Note, the `<fill>` options are for color and black and white.  You only need to set the `<grayscale>` tag or the `<red>`, `<green>`, and `<blue>` tags, not both.

This example uses polygons as the entity that defines the image, but one could just as easily have {{{<line>}}}, {{{<rectangle>}}}, {{{<ellipse>}}}, or any other geometric shape (JUST KEEP THE NAMING CONVENTION STANDARD).  The contents of {{{<shape>}}} would have to be changed accordingly.

Genome 
= Difference Formats =
== Difference Format ==
Shows only the difference between successful generations.  Gives the "surviving species'" history of evolution.
== History Format ==
Shows a complete history of the entire species, records every mutation as well as if it was successful or not.  Used for statistical analysis of success of different mutation probability distributions.
