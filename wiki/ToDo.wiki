 * Figure out what distribution of mutations and probabilites gives fastest results

 * Handle a max number of points
 * Automatically re-seed itself for a continued simulation (DNA and counter)
 * Mode settings: ('RGB','L') color and black & white
 * Figure out how far points should go off the edge
 * ?Remove polygons that aren't rendered
 * Get alpha layer drawing/masking working
 * Find a useful way to display percent or ln(p) completed
